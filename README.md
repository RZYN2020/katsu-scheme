# Katsu Scheme

A Scheme interpreter/compiler in development.

To ensure a smooth development process, I am taking an incremental approach, starting from [pr7rs](https://github.com/jrincayc/r7rs-pico-spec) and gradually adding more features until it achieves near-compatibility with [r7rs](https://small.r7rs.org/attachment/r7rs.pdf). Furthermore, I am striving to integrate various techniques commonly used in dynamic language implementations to enhance its performance.
